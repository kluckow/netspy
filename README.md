# netspy version 2

<h3>Deadline: 04.03.2016, 11:00</h3>
<h3>Installation instructions</h3>
<p>You must have an installed JKD, preferred v.1.7+, and also a set environment variable to its bin folder for being able to compile and execute the Netspy via the batch files, because they are using javac and java commands.</p>
<p>Once you are set up, compile the source code by starting the compile.bat, afterwards start the execute.bat for running the application.</p>
<p>Initially there should be no config.properties inside the resources folder. The path configuration of inbox, quarantine, log and blacklist is generated with a default value set within a fresh config.properties. So if you run into any kind of problems, make sure you do not have it</p>
