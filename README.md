<h3>How to run the application:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Move all .eml-files from data to inbox in order to let netspy scan and transfer them into quarantine</li>
	<li>Run NetSpy.java "as Application". 2 of the 3 .eml-files should then pop up in the quarantine directory</li>
	<li>There is also some information inside the black log box in the lower section of the window. Additionally there should now pop up a log.txt inside the logs folder, which contains some information about the suspicious emails.</li>
</ol>
